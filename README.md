# 3d-bounce-ball

This is a 3D Bounce Ball simulation implemented in C++ using OpenGL. The program creates a virtual environment where a ball moves and bounces within a 3D space, interacting with the floor and walls.

## Features

- 3D Environment: The simulation takes place in a 3D space with a floor and walls, providing a realistic visual experience.
- Ball Movement: The ball moves continuously within the environment, bouncing off the floor and walls based on physics principles.
- Realistic Physics: The simulation incorporates realistic physics calculations to determine the ball's velocity, acceleration, and collision responses.
- User Interaction: Users can interact with the simulation by adjusting parameters such as the ball's initial velocity, gravity, and coefficient of restitution.
- Visualization: The program provides visual feedback through rendering the 3D scene using OpenGL, allowing users to observe the ball's motion and interactions with the environment.
- Configurable Settings: Users can customize various settings such as the size of the environment, the appearance of the ball, and the simulation time step.
